\problemname{Equality}

The villages of your country are located on a straight road.
Each village has an integer wealth, which is negative if the village is in debt.
The make the country look better financially, the King has decided to merge some villages into larger ones.
Since there is only one road in the country, he can only merge two villages $i$ and $j$ if all the villages between $i$ and $j$ are also merged with them.
The wealth of a merged village is the sum of the original wealths of the villages it consists of.

The \textit{equality-index} of two villages is the product of their wealths.
The total equality-index of the country is the sum of the equality-indices of all unordered pairs of villages.
The King has asked you to calculate the largest possible equality-index that his country can have, if he merges the villages wisely.

\section*{Input}
The first line of the input contains one integer, $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^5$),  the number of villages.
The next line contains $n$ space-separated integers between $-10000$ and $10000$.
The $i$th integer is the wealth of the $i$th village on the road, when counting from one of its ends.

\htodo{Make sure fits in limits for long long.}

\section*{Output}
The only line of the output contains the largest possible equality-index of the country.
