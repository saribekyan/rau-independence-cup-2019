\problemname{Homework}

In the math homework you are given a sequence of $n$ positive integers.
You take the sum of every consecutive pair of numbers, to create a new sequence of $n - 1$ positive integers.
You repeat the process until you have one number left, which is the final answer to the homework.
For example, if you start with the sequence $(2, 1, 4, 5)$, you get sequences $(3, 5, 9)$ and $(8, 14)$, and finally $22$, the final answer to the homework.

You have lost all of your math homework, except the final answer!
But the teacher wants to see your full answer that includes the steps of your calculations.
Write a program that will recover the full answer.

\section*{Input}
The only line of the input contains two integers, $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq n$) and $a$ ($1 \leq a \leq 10^9$), the number of elements in the original sequence and the final answer, respectively.

\section*{Output}
If you made a mistake and it is not possible to find an integer sequence of length $n$ with an answer $a$ print ``$-1$'' in the only line of the output.
Otherwise, print $n$ lines, where the $i$th line contains the $i$th sequence of your full answer.
Each sequence should be printed as space-separated integers.
