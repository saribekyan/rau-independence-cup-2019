\problemname{Watering Cacti}

Armen has $n$ cacti, arranged in one line from left to right, one metre apart from one another.
After many years’ of experience he has determined the optimal method of watering his cacti.
First, he waters the leftmost cactus, then he waters the rightmost cactus, then he waters the leftmost unwatered cactus, then the rightmost unwatered cactus, and so on.
Even if the method is best for cacti, Armen feels that he gets tired.
He asks you to find out the distance that he travels every time he needs to water all his cacti.

\section*{Input}
The first and only line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^4$), the number of Armen’s cacti.

\section*{Output}
The output contains the distance, in meters, that Armen travels in order to water all $n$ cacti.
