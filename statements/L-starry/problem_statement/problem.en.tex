\problemname{Starry Sky}

It was dark, one of the beautiful nights of Yerevan.
The weather was wonderful and Armen decided to sleep outside.
He lied down to sleep, but the view of the sky was so interesting that he started to research the starry sky.
He found Ursa Major, Ursa Minor and several other constellations.
Then he realized that several stars form a rectangle.
He was amazed at that, and decided to find some other 4 stars that form a square.
After searching for several minutes he found a square as well.
He then decided to take any 4 stars in the sky and quickly determine type of a quadrangle that they form.
It is often not easy to determine the type of the quadrange quickly, so he is asking you to help him with this interesting task.

\section*{Input}
The input contains 4 lines, each describing coordinates of a star in the sky with 2 integers $x$ and $y$ ($-1000 \leq x, y \leq 1000$).
Armen is able to quickly detect if three points are on a single line, thus, he will not give you such examples.

\section*{Output}
The output should contain one of the following words:
\begin{verbatim}
    Square
    Rectangle
    Rhomb
    Trapezium
    Parallelogram
    Quadrangle
\end{verbatim}
If the given quadrangle is of several types at the same time, you should consider the priority given above.
For example, if the given quadrangle is a square then you should print ``Square,'' even though it is also a rectangle, a rhomb and a parallelogram.
