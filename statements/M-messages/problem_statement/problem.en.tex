\problemname{Messages}

While playing in the garden, Armen finds two ancient rocks which contain inscriptions.
He discovers that the first rock contains $n$ secret binary code words, each written on a separate line on the rock.
The second rock contains $m$ messages, each one is written on a single line on of the rock, using exactly one code word.
Unfortunately, the rocks are broken and Armen can see only the prefixes of the original lines of the rocks.
Thus, he may not be able to uniquely identify which code word matches each message.
Nevertheless, he wants to know, for each message, how many code words can match it.

\section*{Input}
The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \leq n, m \leq 50000$), the number of code words and the number of messages, respectively.
The next $n$ lines of the input contain binary strings, one per line, that represent the code words.
After that, the next $m$ lines contain the binary strings that represent the messages.
Each line on both of the rocks contains at least one character, and at most $10000$ characters.
The total number of characters on the two rocks does not exceed $500000$.

\section*{Output}
The output contains $m$ lines.
The $i$th line contains one integer, the number of code words that the $i$th message could match.
